# This is a really crude hack: If the gateway that has the host route is
# unreachable on layer 2, Linux ignores the host route (if it isn't acting as a
# router) and falls back to the route of the second-longest matching prefix
# (probably the default route). In particular, it also ignores any other host
# route with higher metric. Thus, we need to insert an unreachable route to a
# network that still matches the host, but introduces minimal damage: its /127
ip -6 route add unreachable ${IP6_TO_FETCH}/127
